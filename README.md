# Dockerized web application built with Django, with a container orchestration system.

Cloud-based Web Application built as a part of my Cloud Computing course (Jan 2019). 
the project is REST API based photo sharing platform built using Django. The application has been Dockerized.
The app was split into 2 microservices and run on Docker containers hosted on separate AWS EC2 instances.
I built a container orchestrator that does auto-scaling and load balancing, based on the requests.
